# Rake 2.0 â€“ Modular, Extensible, Event-driven Crawling & Data Migration Framework for PHP
---

1. **Context & Goals:**
   - Rake is a cross-platform data crawling/migration framework, being refactored for simplicity, plugin-ability, modern design patterns, extensibility, maintainability, and testability.
   - There are 3 main components: wp-crawlflow (main app), rake (core library), and rake-wordpress-adapter (WordPress adapter).

2. **Overall Architecture:**
   - The main app (wp-crawlflow) initializes the Rake App, which calls the config loader. The Tooth Factory creates multiple Tooth instances from the config.
   - Each Tooth has multiple Data Sources (Feeds), each Feed has a Data Type (URL, CSV, Sitemap XML, JSON, etc.).
   - Data Source uses a Reception to detect data type, assign mapping rules, and pass to the Parser.
   - The Parser generates Feed Items (product, post, movie, etc.), which are classified and sent to the appropriate Processor Chain (Chain of Responsibility).
   - The Processor Chain processes items sequentially (insert DB, backup, export, etc.), with outputs such as saving to DB, exporting EPUB, JSON, DOCX, CSV, etc.
   - All files/images only store URLs in the resources table; a worker downloads files separately, checks for duplicates via checksum, and updates the resource and parent resource after download.

3. **Applied Patterns & Managers:**
   - **Factory Pattern:** Tooth Factory, HTTP Client Manager, Database Driver Manager.
   - **Builder Pattern:** Feed Item Builder.
   - **Chain of Responsibility:** Processor Chain.
   - **Strategy Pattern:** Selects appropriate parser, reception, client, driver.
   - **Registry/Service Locator:** Central managers (Reception, Parser, Preset, Feed Item Builder, Processor, HTTP Client, Database Driver).
   - **Adapter Pattern:** HTTP Client, Database Driver (standardized interfaces, easily replaceable).
   - **Command Pattern:** Queue/Worker (each task is a command object, easy to retry, rollback, audit).
   - **State Pattern:** Feed Item, Resource, Tooth (pending, processing, done, error, etc.).
   - **Decorator Pattern:** Processor/Feed Item (wrap for logging, validation, caching, etc.).
   - **Observer/Event Bus:** Event-driven, easy for logging, notification, auditing, integrating auxiliary systems.

4. **Resource-centric:**
   - All data (product, post, project, category, image, etc.) is a resource, with URL/file, type, metadata, status, parent link, checksum, etc.
   - All processing steps operate via resources.

5. **Config Loader & Database Driver Loader:**
   - Prefer loading from files (rake.config.php, rake.db.php); if not available, use a transformer to fetch from the database.
   - Tooth Factory and Database Driver Manager receive standard configs to create corresponding Tooth and driver instances.

6. **HTTP Client & DB Driver:**
   - Supports multiple clients (Guzzle, Selenium, Webdriver, Web Bidi, Unirest, etc.) and drivers (wpdb, Eloquent, Doctrine, etc.); developers can register custom adapters.
   - Selects suitable client/driver for each Feed/Tooth.

7. **Technology Packages:**
   - **symfony/dom-crawler:** for DOM parsing.
   - **nesbot/carbon:** for date/time handling.

8. **Batch Mode, CLI-first:**
   - Optimized for automation, cronjobs, CI/CD, detailed logging, resume, retry, no UI required for the core.
   - Separate GUI for mapping rules to inspect DOM and edit rules visually.

9. **Diagram:**
   - Multiple Mermaid diagrams have been created to clearly show modules: Boot, App, Managers, Plugins, processing flows, resources, workers, event bus, patterns, processor groups, file deduplication, resource updates, etc.
   - Ensures all output goes through resources, with patterns clearly highlighted.

10. **Technical Evaluation:**
    - The architecture is robust, plugin-based, extensible, testable, maintainable, cross-platform, resource-centric, and event-driven.
    - Points to note: complexity, need for validation tools, documentation, tests, state/rule/driver/event management.

11. **Description for Rake 2.0:**
    - Proposed description emphasizes modularity, extensibility, event-driven, resource-centric, plugin-based, batch mode, CLI-first, integration of modern packages, suitable for large-scale, multi-source, cross-platform crawling/migration.

**In summary:**
Rake 2.0 is a modern PHP framework for data crawling/migration, plugin-based, resource-centric, event-driven, fully applying design patterns, supporting cross-platform, extensible, maintainable, testable, and professional operation.
